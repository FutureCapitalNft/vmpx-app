VPMX is an ERC-20 token, possibly totally worthless, distributed from capped supply on a first come, first served basis. You only have to pay network gas fees (possibly quite a lot, mind you). Strict First Principles of Crypto: no pre-mint, no pre-allocation, no admin keys, immutable contract. Mint at your own risk. Do your own research before minting. In a likely case of network congestion and high gas prices, it is your own risk whether the transaction goes through or gets stuck in the mempool. We are not responsible for any actions of network validators. Beware of the copycat contracts! Always check the linked contract below before proceeding.
